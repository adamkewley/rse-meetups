# Format

- Each session lasts 45 to 90 minutes:

  - Begins with an informal 10-30 minute presentation/discussion
  - In the remainder, you'll work on your laptop (or in a pair/team) on a concrete problem/challenge. The idea is to allow people to chat, try things out, etc.

- You can drop into any session:

  - The topics are mostly independent, there is no homework

  - You don't need to attend the entire session. The 1h30 is to accommodate additional questions and a more relaxed pace during the practical. Sessions usually last around an hour.

- Please try to use the recommended toolchain during sessions:

  - The recommended toolchain is: Windows/Mac/Ubuntu + Python + Visual Studio Code + Anaconda (optional)
  - The first session covers using/installing these.
  - I recommend a specific toolchain to reduce surprises and to make it easier for attendees to work together. However, vim > emacs 😉


# Abstract

Modern research can involve writing a lot of software. However, in order to save precious teaching time, software-related courses must skip over some of the engineering practicalities. This meetup series explores those practicalities through the lens of creating working, shareable, publication-ready research software.

The meetup format means that we start each session with a short overview of a topic, perhaps with an introductory problem on an interactive platform, interspersed with some short interactive sessions on laptops (there is no pressure to work alone, succeed, etc. - people can pair up, just observe, or participate). The meetup usually ends with a roundup of the session, questions, and proposals for the next session.

The focus of the meetup is to cover development techniques that are practically useful, regardless of programming language. However, any coding content/sessions shall be delivered in Python.
