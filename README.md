# Overview

Modern research can involve writing a lot of software. However, in order to save precious teaching time, software-related courses must skip over some of the engineering practicalities. This meetup series explores those practicalities through the lens of creating working, shareable, publication-ready research software.

The meetup format means that we start each session with a short overview of a topic, perhaps with an introductory problem on an interactive platform, interspersed with some short interactive sessions on laptops (there is no pressure to work alone, succeed, etc. - people can pair up, just observe, or participate). The meetup usually ends with a roundup of the session, questions, and proposals for the next session.

The focus of the meetup is to cover development techniques that are practically useful, regardless of programming language. However, any coding content/sessions shall be delivered in Python.


# Proposed Meetup Topics

> ℹ️ **Note**: This list is just to give you an idea (it's very very provisional).

| Topic | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| Tools | IDEs, text editors, REPL, command line, basic git usage, LLMs (ChatGPT/GH Copilot) |
| Sharing, Publication, and Collaboration | Shared drives, GitHub, GitLab, writing a README, managing dependencies, releasing, publishing to package managers like `pip`, etc. |
| Software Design | Library vs. command-line vs. UI. User-/developer-experience. What is an application? The basics of how applications work. |
| Software Implementation | Iterative development methods. The REPL. Incremental application design. Assertions. Tests. How to implement things done more quickly - and with fewer surprises. |
| Libraries | Command-line parsers, configuration parsers, plotters, renderers |
| Advanced/Specialized topics (later) | Languages with type systems. Native application development (C/C++/Fortran/Rust). Multithreading. GP-GPU. Julia, hardware engineering, etc. |
