# 1. Introduction and Tooling

## Introduction Topics

- Introduce general schedule
- Introduce general vibe for the sessions (e.g. with practical example)
- Who each participant is, why they think they need software
- Discuss unifying themes, goals, etc. that pervade each participant's
  research goals - even if they're in different research groups/fields
- Discuss which parts of those themes are common, and how research software
  engineering techniques (tools, testing, design patterns, general approach)
  might be able to help with those research goals

## Content Topics

General concepts that need to be discussed/delivered/shown/experimented with etc:

- IDEs vs text editors
- REPL
- Command line
- Basic git usage
- Github/documentation (it's obvious, but worth pointing out)
- LLMs (ChatGPT/GH Copilot)

## Delivery Ideas

- Provide a "messy" codebase that participants have to try and unravel using some
  of the tools shown
- Have us work on a toy problem (e.g. sort an array or something basic) and then
  show how the tools complement the workflow
- Present a harder problem (e.g. download data from this API and compute+plot the
  average number of downloads etc.) and then show how all of these tools, when
  combined with a little bit of AI, can get something working very quickly

## Prerequisites

- Try to bring a laptop
- Try to have Visual Studio Code already installed
- Try to have git already installed
- (maybe the AI/LLM stuff can be shown by the presenter, so that participants
   don't all have to get OpenAI/GitHub accounts)
